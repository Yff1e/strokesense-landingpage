      <p>The Philippines has a rich cultural history, and one of its most beautiful treasures is Baybayin—an ancient script used widely in Luzon during the 16th and 17th centuries. Baybayin is more than just letters on a page. It is a symbol of Filipino heritage, identity, and pride. Yet today, few young Filipinos know how to read or write Baybayin properly.</p>
      <p>Learning Baybayin can be challenging. Traditional methods involve printed worksheets, memorization, or in-person classes. While effective to some extent, these methods are often boring, slow, and frustrating, especially for younger learners who are used to digital and interactive experiences.</p>
      <p>This is where StrokeSense comes in—a web-based AI handwriting game designed to teach Baybayin in a fun, engaging, and modern way. StrokeSense combines education, technology, and gamification to make learning Baybayin not only effective but also enjoyable.</p>

        <h2>What is StrokeSense?</h2>
        <p>StrokeSense is a smart platform that lets learners practice Baybayin handwriting digitally. Users can draw characters on their computers, tablets, or touchscreens, while AI gives instant feedback on stroke accuracy, order, and form.</p>
        <p>Unlike worksheets or textbooks, StrokeSense actively guides the learner, highlighting mistakes and showing how to correct them. Each correct stroke earns points, unlocks badges, and moves the learner through fun levels and challenges. Over time, learners gain confidence, improve their handwriting, and memorize the script naturally.</p>
        <p>In short, StrokeSense turns Baybayin learning into a game, making it easier, faster, and much more enjoyable than traditional methods.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="why" id="why">
        <h2>Why StrokeSense Matters?</h2>
        <p>Baybayin is part of the Philippines’ cultural identity, but knowledge of the script is fading. Few schools teach it extensively, and most learning happens in isolated workshops or informal sessions. Learners often give up because it feels difficult, slow, or boring.</p>
        <p>StrokeSense solves this problem by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Making learning interactive:</b> Instead of passive memorization, users actively write and see their progress.</li>
          <li><b>Providing instant feedback:</b> AI identifies mistakes in real-time, helping learners improve with each stroke.</li>
          <li> <b>Adding fun and motivation:</b> Points, badges, and challenges keep users engaged.</li>
          <li><b>Preserving cultural heritage:</b> By teaching correct writing and traditional calligraphy styles, StrokeSense helps users connect with Filipino history.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>With StrokeSense, learning Baybayin becomes accessible to anyone, anywhere, whether at home, in school, or online.</p>

    <h2>How StrokeSense Works</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
      <p>StrokeSense is designed to be easy and intuitive, even for complete beginners:</p>
      
      <h3>1. Interactive Handwriting Practice</h3>
      <p>Users draw Baybayin characters using a mouse, touchscreen, or stylus. The AI evaluates the strokes instantly. Did the user start in the right place? Was the angle correct? Were the proportions right? Feedback is immediate and visual, so learners can correct themselves on the spot.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Gamified Learning Levels</h3>
      <p>StrokeSense uses a level-based system, starting with simple characters and gradually introducing more complex ones, including ligatures and calligraphy styles. Learners earn points, unlock achievements, and advance through challenges, keeping motivation high.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Personalized Feedback</h3>
      <p>The AI adapts to the learner's pace. If a user struggles with certain characters, StrokeSense provides extra exercises to reinforce learning. If the learner excels, the game becomes more challenging, maintaining engagement.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Progress Tracking and Rewards</h3>
      <p>StrokeSense keeps track of accuracy, speed, and improvement. Users can see visual charts of their progress, celebrate milestones, and even earn printable certificates of achievement.</p>
      
      <h3>5. Cultural Insights</h3>
      <p>Each character includes a short explanation of its history and meaning. Users not only learn to write but also understand the cultural context of Baybayin, deepening their appreciation for the script.</p>
